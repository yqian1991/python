For three years, the young attorney had been taking his brief vacations at this
country inn.  The last time he'd finally managed an affair with the innkeeper's
daughter.  Looking forward to an exciting few days, he dragged his suitcase up
the stairs of the inn, then stopped short.  There sat his lover with an infant
on her lap!  "Helen, why didn't you write when you learned you were pregnant?"
he cried.  "I would have rushed up here, we could have gotten married, and the
baby would have my name!"  "Well," she said, "when my folks found out about my
condition, we sat up all night talkin' and talkin' and decided it would be
better to have a bastard in the family than a lawyer."
